== AsmackLibrary ==

AsmackLibrary contains the pieces required by an user app to use the xmpp
service. It does bundle the smack library and a smack compatible parser, thus
allowing easier porting of existing smack applications.

== Goals ==

- Smack compatible Stanza -> Object parser
- Boilerplate code to interact with the XMPP service

== Anti-Goals ==

- Protocol specific hacks
- Smack manager compatibility (ChatManager, ....), they aren't designed for
  constrained environments
